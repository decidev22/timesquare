# Timesquare
## What is a Timesquare.io project

Timesquare.io Project is from my idea of displaying news titles and wider information updates in separate categories.
Displaying news with Typography and visuals focused, Timesquare.io should be good enough and not disturbingly overwhelming and the way data is presented on it should be suitable for wallpaper.

# How will Timesquare.io work

## Transitions to new views
View Model in Timesquare.io will be based on a few different variations of the TimeSquare-shaped structure.
Each x amount of time the website will display a part of the website - zoomed in - showing only readable and viewable size of it.

For instance...

## Categories and what goes under the categories.

| Category  | Contents | Maps |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| General  | All news with minimal details and visuals focused | TimeSquare |
| Sports  | Scores, news titles, and visuals | TimeSquare |
| Fashion | Trending fashion visuals, just like billboard ads but AI curated | Broadway |
| Tech | Tech news, security, devices, updates and more with visuals | Silicon Valley |
| Politics | Political news collections with visuals | TimeSquare |
| Finance | Finance news | Wall Street |


Each building block (news block) in Timesquare.io will have similar news content as long as the news content has heavily related topics.
For instance, if Building 1 has news on 'Andy eating doughnut', then the news below it may be something like 'Trend of tech people on a doughnut is crazy!'

# Technologies to be used

TypeScript, Next13, React, Node, Express, AWS Lambda (to be discussed), and Cloudflare (to be discussed).
