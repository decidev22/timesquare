## What is a Timesquare.io project

Timesquare.io Project is from my idea of displaying news titles and wider information updates in separate categories.
Displaying news with Typography and visuals focused, Timesquare.io should be good enough and not disturbingly overwhelming and the way data is presented on it should be suitable for wallpaper.

# How will Timesquare.io work

## Categories and what goes under the categories.

| Category  | Contents |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| General  | All news with minimal details and visuals focused |
| Sports  | Scores, news titles, and visuals |
| Fashion | Trending fashion visuals, just like billboard ads but AI curated |
| Tech | Tech news, security, devices, updates and more with visuals |
| Politics | Political news collections with visuals |


Each building block (news block) in Timesquare.io will have similar news content as long as the news content has heavily related topics.
For instance, if Building 1 has news on 'Andy eating doughnut', then the news below it may be something like 'Trend of tech people on a doughnut is crazy!'

# Technologies to be used

TypeScript, Next13, React, Node, Express, AWS Lambda (to be discussed), and Cloudflare (to be discussed).
